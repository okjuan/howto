write sparely
with words pruned and scraped off

why though?

It's not just about saving time
Nor is it just for not annoying an impatient reader
It's for creating a certain aesthetic experience

Words standing by themselves look and feel different
They _mean_ different, perhaps?
They mean more by having to shoulder more meaning in the sentence
When you don't need a cluster of words to group together to hold a concept up,
when you let a single word alone do it,
when you find a word that can do it,
there is more cohesiveness, more focus, more clarity in the meaning being conveyed
in the same way that a single visionary can produce what a committee cannot
