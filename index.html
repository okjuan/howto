We should also fight the urge to read books quickly.
If a book grabs your attention and pulls you in, go ahead.
But don’t hurry through sentences to make your reading session feel more productive.
Read a chunk and consider what you’re getting out of it.
If there’s nothing to digest, then why are you reading it?</p>

I often <a href="https://okjuan.medium.com/feeling-good-about-ditching-books-1c4633fd87f">ditch a book</a> without finishing it because I know I’m going to forget most of it anyway.
I also don’t try to read for hours in a row unless I’m engrossed.
At a certain point, it just becomes information binging.
Better to chew on a good morsel, digest it, and move on.</p>

        </h3><p>Despite all my admiration and enchantment while reading Hemingway’s memoir <em>A Moveable Feast</em> I couldn’t help but frowning at his description of his writing mantra: “make instead of describing”. Surely he’s been describing all along? He says he learned from a fellow writer to “distrust adjectives”. I don’t know exactly what it is he learned about adjectives because he did not abandon them.</p>
