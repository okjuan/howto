Several years ago, in the last and lightest semester of my Computer Science degree, I spent a good deal of my free time studying YouTube videos about politics, philosophy, and sociology.

One of my favorites was Professor Raymond Geuss's lecture on the process of [Alienation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/alienation/).
In it he distinguishes between two kinds of frameworks: **normative** and **evaluative**.
(Academic-y right? Bear with me.)
Both are frameworks for understanding the world, models that simplify a wild, diverse world into a manageable set of rules and components.

However, only the **normative** ones claim that their rules and components compose part of reality's underlying skeleton.
**Evaluative** frameworks are humbler.
They offer you rules and components that, while they help in _understanding_ the world, don't decode its blueprint.
They just help you sketch a good picture.

Whether or not these are Geuss's precise concepts, they have stayed with me and helped me sort through new ideas.
