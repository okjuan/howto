Freud, apparently, thought dreams prevented us from going crazy.

According to him, dreams are expressions of the desires and fears we don't dare face in waking life, facets of ourselves that we keep submerged beneath our consciousness like a child smothering a ball under the surface of a pool.
And, in the dark of night, dreams relieve the pressure by giving audience to these repressed urges.
Were they not allowed these covert outings, but blocked and pushed indefinitely, they would eventually burst through the surface and rupture our psyche.
And so dreams are the release valve for the unrelenting force our unconscious exerts to have its will expressed.

This idea intrigued a young William Dement and launched him into a trailblazing career in sleep science.
Could he use science prove Freud's theory right?
REM sleep, which Dement discovered, seemed promising.
Studies proved it to be both indispensable and the only part of sleep when dreaming occurred.

And there was the case of a radio personality suffering a mental breakdown during his [201-hour "wakeathon"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Tripp), in which he broadcasted, without sleep, for a week straight.
Why did he start hallucinating and dissociating?
Was it just the drugs he took to stay awake, or could it have been the lack of dreams, which was keeping his psyche in balance?
Dr. Dement's faith in Freud's theory finally faltered after accompanying a high school senior's [record-breaking sleepless marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Gardner_sleep_deprivation_experiment) of eleven days and witnessing nothing much worse than acute fatigue and acute crankiness.

Some scientists have claimed the opposite to Freud's theory -- that dreams not only do nothing but mean nothing.
They are a random side-effect of the brain function which produces them, a periodic electric signal that occurs right before and during REM sleep.
Our eyes move rapidly and we experience absurd scenarios because electricity is coursing through our neural network like water splashing over rocks.
But, as Dement points out, even if the ripples of electricity start out with no intended destination, their traversal is influenced by pathways already formed.
In the same way that water trickling down the face of a rock depends on the rock's shape and texture, the images projected by our mind in dreams depend on the path our neurons allow an electrical signal to traverse.
Meaning, accumulated over our life and throughout that particular day, is encoded in neural connections.

Dreams have things to tell us, whether or not all scientists agree.
It is an ordinary thing to dream about things that came up during the day.
In his essay [The Kekulé Problem](https://nautil.us/the-kekul-problem-236574/), Cormac McCarthy considers the curious phenomenon of problem-solving while sleeping, with particular interest on why solutions are presented mysteriously as images and not in plain language.
He offers a clever answer: the brain is old, but language is new.
And, just like us, the brain prefers to communicate in its native tongue: imagery.

But this idea, as stirring as it is, might be no more accurate than Freud's.
In his book [Livewired](https://eagleman.com/books/livewired/), neuroscientist David Eagleman proposes a theory of dreams and a rather different answer to the Kekulé Problem.
The electrical signals emitted in REM sleep are scheduled to exercise the part of our brains typically dedicated to vision, which would not see much action in the dark of night otherwise.

(To be completed. Almost done.)

Notes:
- Brains, unlike rocks, change all the time.
- Neural rewiring happens all the time and not just in children
- David Eagleman and assistant(?) propose a theory: dreams are a side-effect of the brain routine exercise of the visual part of our brain, which it does to make sure the neural real estate is not "annexed" by other senses
    - REM sleep (and therefore dreaming) is less common the older we get, we correlates with the decrease in risk of brain colonialism by other senses
